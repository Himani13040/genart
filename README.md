# Generative Art with JavaScript
First attempt at Creative coding by following through Generative Art Workshop by Matt DesLauriers on Frontend Masters

# Installation
Assuming that you already have latest versions of Node.js and npm installed, run:

``` npm install``` 

In the root genart directory to install the required dependencies: `canvas-sketch`, `canvas-sketch-util` and `nice-color-palettes`

# Running locally
This repository includes 3 different generative art files: `colored-blots.js`, `uniformly-random-circles.js` and the final one `convergent-or-divergent.js`. 

Run the following command to view the artwork:

```canvas-sketch convergent-or-divergent.js --open```

You can update the file name in the above command if you're making changes to a different file and want to see your changes being rendered
